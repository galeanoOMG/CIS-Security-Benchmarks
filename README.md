# CIS-Security-Benchmarks

(30/11/16) CIS (Center for Internet Security) recently changes download forms of PDF Benchmarks, now they have to send a link by mail.

Today (03/12/16) I requested several downloads in tow different emails and I do not get the link with the Benchmark, so I've done a public repository to be of help to those who encounter the same problem.
